# Make School Assassins
_Official game rules_

## Overview
Assassins is a game where a number of people each receive a "target" who they must "assassinate" by some means. Everyone knows their target but not who is targeting them. There are many variations of the game, so you may be familiar with different rules.

## Current game
At 9pm Nov 29th game 0.1 was set up, with plans to start play at 7am the following morning. A few hours after, it came to light that human error caused flaws in the popcicle stick distribution. For this reason, targets were reassigned for game 0.2. 0.2 sticks have an orange mark on the end to distinguish them. They will be handed out by Nabil at Make School on Nov 30th (Wed (today)). Play for game 0.2 will begin at 7pm (not 6 as previously stated).

## Setup
Right now, we use a python script to randomly generate the targets. The program ensures that there is precisely one loop, rather then several small closed loops. Nabil (who is not playing) will distribute popsicle sticks with the targets name on them to the correct people.

## Killing
To kill your target, simply sneak up on them and tag them with the popsicle stick that has their name on it. The (now deceased) target must then give their assassin the popcicle stick with their target, this then becomes the assassin's new target

## Defense
If you think someone may be about to assassinate you, hold both hands above your head and shake them. This action protects you from assassination while you are doing it. You may do it as often as you like for as long as you like.

## Safezones
A safezone is somewhere where assassinations are forbidden, in contrast to a killzone where they can take place. Any attempt to assassinate someone in a safezone will have no affect, except to inform them of your identity. Everywhere is a killzone unless specified as a safezone below.
* The target's own room (safezone)
* Bathrooms (safezone)
* The kitchen at 851 (safezone)
* Everywhere in Make School (safezone) __except__:
	* The enterence lobby (killzone)
	* The area under the kitchen area (killzone)
	* The kitchen area (killzone) __except__:
		* the food preparation area, on either side of the divide (where the fridges and cabenets are) (safezone)

Remember that anywhere unspecified is a killzone. This includes the common room, hallways and the streets.

## Winning
The game is over when someone assassinates someone else who's target is them. This means that there is only one person left in the game, and thus they are the winner. You can think of the targets as a loop, with each assassination as the shrinking of the loop. The only way you could possibly kill someone who's target is you is if you are the last person in the loop.

## Known Information
The only officially known information is the complete list of all players initially in the game. This should be put in this Github repo. Other information (such as who has been killed and by whom) is not necessarily known by anyone except those involved. If there are any problems, Nabil will ask around and figure out whats up. You must be honest with Nabil but can lie to anyone else if you wish.

## Conflict Resolution and Rule Suggestions
Talk to Nabil, as he is not playing. He may consult with William or others if they are not involved.

## Details
These are things that should either be obvious or unimportant, but I want to have here for the sake of over communication. Keep in mind, while we encourage creative strategies, exploiting purely semantic loopholes that reduce the fun for everyone else will not be tolerated. Just because something is not mentioned here is not an invitation to do it. Also, if you find a "bug" in the game rules, please report it to Nabil.
* When an assassination takes place, the popcicle stick must be in contact with the assassins skin and must touch the targets skin, clothes or hair.
* A target can not be assassinated if they have at least one foot in a safe zone. The location of the assassin does not matter.
* This version of the game is an unstable untested beta. We reserve the rights to change the rules at any time.
